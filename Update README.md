# Wallet Wise

The Wallet-Wise software is a platform designed to facilitate a symbiotic relationship between food vendors and students at Cebu Institute of Technology University (CIT-U). This document outlines the scope of the Wallet-Wise software, detailing its functionalities, limitations, and target users.

  #### 1. Wallet-Wise empowers food vendors to showcase their different culinary creations by providing essential information such as food type, food name, price, quantity, images, and the food availability. 
  
  #### 2. On the flip side, it empowers students by enabling them to explore a diverse range of food options, add preferred items to a virtual cart, efficiently proceed to checkout, and have it delivered to them by their co-students. 
  
  #### 3. This symbiotic relationship between vendors and students is underpinned by features like order tracking, delivery coordination, and a chat system, fostering a vibrant sense of community interaction.
